# Disable GitHub Pages

## 🚨 **Issue:**
The repository has a failing `github-pages` environment that was created when we had GitHub Pages deployment workflows. Since we now use Vercel for deployments, this environment is no longer needed and is causing failures.

## ✅ **Solution:**
Follow these steps to disable GitHub Pages:

### **Step 1: Disable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/prepguides/prepguides.dev
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**
4. Under **Source**, change it from the current setting to **"None"**
5. Click **Save**

### **Step 2: Verify Environment Cleanup**
After disabling GitHub Pages:
1. Go to **Actions** → **Environments**
2. The `github-pages` environment should no longer appear
3. Only `Production` and `Preview` (Vercel) environments should remain

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**
- ✅ No more failing `github-pages` environment
- ✅ Only Vercel environments remain active
- ✅ Clean deployment status without conflicts
- ✅ All deployments handled by Vercel bot

## 📋 **Current Environments:**
- ✅ **Production** - Vercel production deployments
- ✅ **Preview** - Vercel preview deployments  
- ❌ **github-pages** - Should be removed (failing)

This will resolve the failing GitHub Pages environment issue! 🚀
