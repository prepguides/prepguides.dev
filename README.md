## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/prepguides/prepguides.dev.git
cd prepguides.dev

# Start local server
./serve.sh

# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Adding Your Own Content
1. **Add HTML files** to the `public/diagrams/` directory
2. **Create new pages** following the existing structure
3. **Update navigation** in `index.html`
4. **Deploy to Vercel** - automatic deployment on push
