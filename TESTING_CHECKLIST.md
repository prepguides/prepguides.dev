# Algorithm Visualization Testing Checklist

## üß™ Testing Workflow

### 1. Local Testing Setup
- [x] Start local server: `./serve.sh`
- [x] Access: http://localhost:8000
- [x] Test all algorithm pages

### 2. Binary Search Tree (BST) Testing
**URL**: http://localhost:8000/algorithms/binary-search-tree.html

#### Visual Issues to Check:
- [ ] Tree structure renders correctly with connecting lines
- [ ] Nodes display with proper positioning
- [ ] Insert operation works and shows tree growth
- [ ] Delete operation works and shows tree restructuring
- [ ] Search operation highlights correct path
- [ ] Traversal operations show correct order
- [ ] Back button navigation works

#### Functional Issues to Check:
- [ ] All buttons are clickable and responsive
- [ ] Input validation works (numbers only)
- [ ] Error handling for invalid operations
- [ ] Animation speed is appropriate
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### 3. BFS/DFS Graph Traversal Testing
**URL**: http://localhost:8000/algorithms/bfs-dfs-graph-traversal.html

#### Visual Issues to Check:
- [ ] Graph generates with proper node positioning
- [ ] Edges connect nodes correctly
- [ ] BFS algorithm shows level-by-level traversal
- [ ] DFS algorithm shows depth-first traversal
- [ ] Queue/Stack visualization updates correctly
- [ ] Node highlighting works during traversal
- [ ] Step-by-step information displays

#### Functional Issues to Check:
- [ ] Algorithm switching works (BFS/DFS)
- [ ] Graph size changes work
- [ ] Start node selection works
- [ ] Reset functionality works
- [ ] Animation speed is appropriate

### 4. Trie Operations Testing
**URL**: http://localhost:8000/algorithms/trie-operations.html

#### Visual Issues to Check:
- [ ] Trie structure renders correctly
- [ ] Root node displays properly
- [ ] Child nodes connect with labeled edges
- [ ] Insert operation shows path creation
- [ ] Search operation highlights correct path
- [ ] Delete operation removes nodes appropriately
- [ ] Word list updates correctly

#### Functional Issues to Check:
- [ ] Insert operation works for new words
- [ ] Search operation finds existing words
- [ ] Delete operation removes words
- [ ] Input validation (letters only)
- [ ] Predefined word buttons work
- [ ] Clear trie functionality works

### 5. Sorting Algorithms Testing
**URL**: http://localhost:8000/algorithms/sorting.html

#### Visual Issues to Check:
- [ ] Array visualization displays correctly
- [ ] Sorting animations are smooth
- [ ] Algorithm comparisons work
- [ ] Performance metrics display
- [ ] Step-by-step explanations show

#### Functional Issues to Check:
- [ ] All sorting algorithms work
- [ ] Speed controls work
- [ ] Array size changes work
- [ ] Reset functionality works

## üêõ Common Issues to Look For

### Visual Issues:
1. **Missing connecting lines** in tree/graph structures
2. **Incorrect node positioning** causing overlap
3. **Broken animations** or jerky movements
4. **Responsive design** issues on mobile
5. **Color coding** not working properly

### Functional Issues:
1. **JavaScript errors** in browser console
2. **Button clicks** not responding
3. **Input validation** not working
4. **Navigation** between pages broken
5. **Performance** issues with large datasets

### Browser Compatibility:
1. **Chrome** - Primary testing browser
2. **Firefox** - Secondary testing browser
3. **Safari** - Mobile testing
4. **Edge** - Windows testing

## üîß Debugging Steps

### 1. Browser Console Check
```javascript
// Open browser dev tools (F12)
// Check Console tab for errors
// Check Network tab for failed requests
```

### 2. Visual Debugging
- Inspect element to check CSS
- Verify DOM structure
- Check if JavaScript is executing

### 3. Performance Testing
- Test with different data sizes
- Check animation smoothness
- Monitor memory usage
